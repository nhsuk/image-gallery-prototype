        <p><strong>Pacemaker implantation is a procedure where a small electrical device called a pacemaker is surgically implanted in your chest.</strong></p>

<p>A pacemaker sends electrical signals to your heart to help it beat regularly. </p>
<p>It can greatly improve your quality of life if you have problems with your heart, like slow or irregular heartbeats. It can also be lifesaving if you have a high chance of a cardiac arrest or some types of heart disease.</p>

<p>Fitting a pacemaker is a very common type of heart surgery.</p>
<h2>WWhen a pacemaker is used</h2>

<p>Your heart is a muscle thatâ€™s controlled by electrical signals. Sometimes these signals are not received properly, which means the heart cannot beat normally.</p>
<p>Heart conditions that may be helped by a pacemaker include:</p> <ul>
<li>a heart that beats too slowly (bradycardia)</li>
<li>a heart that beats too fast <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/supraventricular-tachycardia-svt/">(tachycardia)</a>
</li>
<li>irregular heartbeats (a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-block/">a heart block</a>
)</li>
<li>cardiac arrest, which is when the heart stops beating completely</li>
</ul>


<h2>What happens during a pacemaker implantation</h2>
<p>The operation to implant a pacemaker is done by a heart surgeon.</p>
<p>It's usually done using <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/local-anaesthesia/">local anaesthetic</a>
, which means you'll be awake during the procedure but will not feel any pain.</p>
<p>The pacemaker is usually placed under your skin near your collarbone, on the left side of your chest. The wires that are attached to the device are then guided through a blood vessel to your heart.</p>
<p>You will probably be in the operating theatre for around 1 hour, and most people are able to leave hospital on the same day, or on the following day.</p>
