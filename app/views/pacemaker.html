<p>A pacemaker is a small device that sends electrical signals to your heart to help it beat regularly.</p>
<p>Fitting a pacemaker (called implantation) is a very common type of heart surgery.</p>
<p>A pacemaker can greatly improve your quality of life if you have problems with your heart, like slow or irregular heartbeats. It can also be lifesaving if you have a high chance of a cardiac arrest or some types of heart disease.</p>
<h2>What pacemaker are used for</h2>
<p>Your heart is a muscle thatâ€™s controlled by electrical signals. Sometimes these signals are not received properly, which means the heart cannot beat normally.</p>
<p>Heart conditions that may be helped by a pacemaker include:</p> <ul>
<li>a heart that beats too slowly (bradycardia)</li>
<li>a heart that beats too fast (tachycardia)</li>
<li>irregular heartbeats (a heart block)</li>
<li>cardiac arrest, which is when the heart stops beating completely</li>
</ul>

<h2>How a pacemaker is implanted</h2>
<p>The operation to implant a pacemaker is done by a heart surgeon.</p>
<p>It's usually done using local anaesthetic, which means you'll be awake during the procedure but will not feel any pain.</p>
<p>The pacemaker is usually placed under your skin near your collarbone, on the left side of your chest. The wires that are attached to the device are then guided through a blood vessel to your heart.</p>
<p>You will probably be in the operating theatre for around 1 hour, and most people are able to leave hospital on the same day, or on the following day.</p>
