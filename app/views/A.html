<h2>Check if it's chickenpox</h2>
<p>An itchy spotty rash is the main symptom of chickenpox. </p>
<h3>Stages of the rash</h3>

<h4>Stage 1: small spots appear</h4>
<p>The spots:</p>
<ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
  <li>are usually round and less than 1cm in size</li>
  <li>can be anywhere on the body and might spread or stay in a small area</li>
  <li>may be red, pink, the same colour or darker than surrounding skin depending on your skin tone</li>
  <li>may be harder to see on brown and black skin</li>
</ul>

<p>New spots might appear while others are becoming blisters or forming a scab.</p>


<h3>Other symptoms</h3>
<p>Before or after the rash appears, you might also get:</p>
<ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>aches and pains, and generally feel unwell</li>
  <li>loss of appetite</li>
</ul>
<p>Chickenpox can make children feel miserable, even if they do not have many spots.</p>
<p>Chickenpox is usually much worse in adults.</p>
<p>It's possible to get chickenpox more than once, although it's unusual.
