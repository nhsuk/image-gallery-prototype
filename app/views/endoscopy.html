<h1>Endoscopy</h1>


  <section>

        <p><strong>An endoscopy is a procedure where organs inside your body are looked at using an instrument called an endoscope.</strong></p>
<p>An endoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube that has a light and camera at one end. Images of the inside of your body are shown on a television screen.</p>

        <p>Endoscopes can be put into the body through the mouth and down the throat, or through the bottom.</p>
<p>An endoscope can also be put inside the body through a small&nbsp;cut (incision) made in the skin when keyhole surgery is being done.</p>

        <h2>When an endoscopy is used</h2>
<p>An endoscopy can be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>investigate unusual symptoms </li>
<li>help perform certain types of surgery </li>
</ul>
<p>An endoscope can also be used to remove a small sample of tissue to be looked at more closely. This is called a <a href="/conditions/biopsy/">biopsy</a>.</p>

        <h2>What happens during an endoscopy</h2>

<h3>During an endoscopy procedure</h3>
<p>An endoscopy is not usually painful, but it can be uncomfortable. Most people only have mild discomfort, similar to&nbsp;<a href="/conditions/indigestion/">indigestion</a> or a sore throat.</p>
<p>The procedure is usually done while you're awake. You may be given a <a href="/conditions/local-anaesthesia/">local anaesthetic</a> to numb a specific area of your body. This may be in the form of a spray or lozenge to&nbsp;numb your throat, for example.</p>
<p>You may also be&nbsp;offered a sedative to help you relax and make you less aware of what's going on around you.</p>
<p>The endoscope will be carefully&nbsp;put into your body. Depending on the part of your body being looked at, it may be put into your:</p>
<ul>
<li>mouth and down your throat </li>
<li>bottom (anus)</li>
<li>urethra&nbsp;â€“ the tube&nbsp;that you pee through </li>
</ul>
<p>An endoscopy usually takes between 15 and 45 minutes, depending on what it's being used for.&nbsp;You can usually go home the same day and do not have to stay in hospital overnight.</p>
