<p>This is a close-up image of chickenpox spots on white skin. You cannot tell what part of the body is shown.</p>
<p>There are about 10 spots that vary in size from about 1mm to 1cm Some spots are close together.</p>
<p>Some of the bigger spots are raised and have scabs over them. The scabs are yellow and pink and the skin around the scab is pink. Some scabs look soft and seem to be filled with fluid.</p>
<p>The smaller spots look like tiny pink blisters.</p>
