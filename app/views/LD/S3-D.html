This is a close-up image of the chickenpox rash on dark brown skin.  Itâ€™s unclear what body part is being shown.

The whole area is covered in spots, most are 2mm to 4mm across.  Some spots are joined together, others are 1cm to 3cm apart.

Most spots are raised and have scabs over them., which are a darker shade of brown than the surrounding skin. Some of the scabs look grey. There are also some smaller spots which are not scabbed over.
