<p>This is a close-up image of the chickenpox rash on dark brown skin.  Itâ€™s unclear what body part is being shown.</p>
<p>The whole area is covered in spots, most are 2mm to 4mm across.  Some spots are joined together, others are 1cm to 3cm apart.</p>
<p>Most spots are raised and have scabs over them., which are a darker shade of brown than the surrounding skin. Some of the scabs look grey. There are also some smaller spots which are not scabbed over.</p>
