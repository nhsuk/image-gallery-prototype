 <p>This is an image of the chickenpox rash on light brown skin.</p>

 <p>There are about 40 spots on someoneâ€™s chest and on a small part of their upper arm.</p>

  <p>Most spots are flat less than 5mm across and have dark red scabs. The skin around the scabs looks pink. Some spots are 1cm to 3cm apart, some are further apart. </p>
